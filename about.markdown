## Programming! 🧑‍💻
My first programming language was Python, which I learned after quarantine. It seemed
                    pretty friendly to me, until I saw Django 😂. I used python primarely for making light concepts of applications, chatbots (discord/telegram),
                    small games (pygame) and NEAT (exploring neural networks)

For a short period of time, I was learning C# for working with Unity, but because of lack of time in school days, it didn't end with a single project
                    fully completed. Still, some small sketches of applications are left on my hard drive ;) In that time, I worked with WinForms too, but saw no potential and
                    interest there.

Finally, my Web development path started, after I got into ADA. I started learning WEB using <a href="https://scrimba.com/">Scrimba</a>, that btw, Davud
                recomended me. Now, I am learning framework called React 😃! I didn't master any of those spheres that are mentioned above, but I still find
                it very interesting for me to continue, no matter if I do it right or not 😅

## Photography! 📸
I also do Photography!
I own <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_650D">Canon EOS 650D</a>! This is my first camera, and i love it,
                as it does everything what beginner needs to learn for a cheap price! I have standart kit and two SD Cards for it 😁 Though, nowadays I use my phone's camera (S24 Ultra), as the algorythms do better than pure optics.
I am posting pictures on my Instagram page, which would be mentioned lower on that page.
