# SITE 1101 Project 1
### In this project, we played with logic gates, basically the “yes/no” brains of computers. Using gates like AND, OR, and NOT, we made tiny circuits that decide things using only 0s and 1s. It turns out computers think very simply… just very fast.

# Discord bots
### At some point, i got into a Discord community of a city in Minecraft, which needed a discord bot. In exchange for resources, extra permissions, and other things, I started developing this bot, gaining priceless experience.
